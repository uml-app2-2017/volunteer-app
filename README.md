# Volun-T
## The Pitch
Lend a helping hand in your community! Need to do community service hours for school? Want to make your community a better place? Maybe you're just bored. Whatever the reason, Volun-T is the go-to solution. See who needs help around you; which can range from a ride to the doctors or running errands. 
On the other hand, if you require assistance, Volun-T is your solution, too! Our easy-to-use interface makes it easy and safe to ask for assistance.
